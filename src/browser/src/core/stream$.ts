/**
 *
 * There are three types of navigation we need to handle:
 * 1. DOMContentLoaded (entering the site) events
 * 2. popstate (browser back/forward button clicks) events
 * 3. `<a hurl="x">` (link clicking)
 *
 * These events have different payloads and need to be
 * harmonized in order to use them consistently
 *
 * ## getting the `hurl` property from the various events:
 * 1. ev.target.location.hurl
 * 2. ev.target.location.hurl
 * 3. ev.target.hurl
 *
 * for raw events, we can just transform them, but for link
 * clicking we need to convert/wrap it to align with the
 * destructuring of the others
 *
 * see _HURL in `/commands/routing.js` for ad-hoc stream
 * injection example
